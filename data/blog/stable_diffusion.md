I know that artificial intelligence is not in my line of Web technologies (yet), but as I have said in other posts. I'm a very curious person, I like to know how things work and these days I found an incredible project where the computer uses its intelligence to CREATE images from 0, the [Stable Diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion)! :hushed:

So let's break down why I added this post, why not use some other service, and of course how it works.

## :question: Why

---

I wanted to change my profile and polish it for some time, I waited for the time and decided to study more technologies and level up, raising my knowledge. One day, I was watching the news and I came across the magic of artificial intelligence, my Full Stack Programming teacher [Igor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZMEgmqBpf0&ab_channel=ProgramadorBR), informed us in one of your videos, about it, and decide to go after it, search about it and understand how it works!

The programmer who developed the technology has done great documentation on his [GitHub](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui), open source code for everyone to use.

## :green_apple: Communities

---

With several active arts communities, I see that this can make a big difference in the digital world!

One of the biggest communities where you can be inspired by other designers [Lexica](https://lexica.art/?), in it you can get the model of how they used the settings to reach that result.

## :hammer: How it works?

---

First you should install [Stable Diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion) on your computer. I used the help of a video on the channel [IgorIA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVRnheLi3hU&t=301s&ab_channel=IgorIA), where it follows the step by step of how you create your first image.

For this to work, we need two main things: [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [GitBash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to clone the project from [ AUTOMATIC1111](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/). Optionally, you can also use some kind of template, I used from this site [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5), to cache.

### How to generate?

Starting off, we set up the environment as we want the image to be created, and as the main text the computer should base on or upload your image, in the `img2img` tab.

With the same image, some other results in different tests:

## :white_check_mark: Conclusion

---

And that's it, with little, thousands of opportunities. But a little tiring, I don't think there's any point in writing or sending anything. I want to study more to improve my knowledge and have conclusive improvements in my future tests! I look forward to coming back and writing more about this artificial intelligence path for you.
